# Task

* Use (at least) two methods from class
* Justify them
* Combine (at least) two datasets used in the labs
* Provide a list of five LSOAs in Liverpool identified as disadvantaged *and*
  popular. Be explicit about what definition you use for each of them
* Justify your choice of the list on the basis of your analysis
* Remember to *always* document your code

Full detail list on course website

# Limits

* Submitted by **Monday, December 12th. 2016**
* 750 words (sharp!)
* Three (3) figures. To avoid "cheating", the definition of a figure this time
  is changed to "an object that comes out of a single `matplotlib.figure`". You create a
  new `matplotlib.figure` everytime:
    * You call any `seaborn` function and do not append the output into an
      axis `ax`
    * You set up a new canvas using `plt.subplots`

# Submission

* Turnitin
* Do **not** submit raw notebook this time
* Instead, submit an HTML version (from a running notebook, you can convert it into html
  in `File` $\rightarrow$ `Download as` $\rightarrow$ `HTML`)
* Make sure the HTML page renders correctly independently (e.g. copy it to a
  different folder and open it on a browser to see all the elements are there
  as you would expect)

# Marking guide

* Minimum requirements are **basic**
* Including some of the suggestions is positively valued
* Routes that are not suggested but go beyond what is suggested is
  even better
* Creativity counts: doing what is suggested exactly the way it's been taught
  is OK but going the extra mile is valued

# Help

* Unless it's strictly personal, please **post to the forum** (faster answer)
* You are **most encouraged** to not only ask but to **respond** as well
* Feel free to run by me ideas in Lab time
