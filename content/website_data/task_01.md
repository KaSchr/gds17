### **Assignment 1** - *Raising awareness of multiple deprivation*

* Type: `Coursework`
* [Equivalent to 2,500 words] Maps, code and 500 words.
* Due on **Wednesday, November 8th-2017** (Week 7).
* 40% of the final mark
* Chance to be reassessed
* Electronic submission only.

In this assignment, you will take the role of the data editor of a local newspaper that wants to write about the geography of deprivation. In order to raise awareness of the problem among your readers, you will have to create a compelling visualization that is intuitive and attractive but also rigorous. In addition, in order to convince your most skeptical and data-savvy readers, you will have to provide the code used to create the visualization in a way that allows reproducibility.

Using data from the Index of Multiple Deprivation, as well as from the Census, create at least three and no more than five maps to display different angles and interesting patterns related to multiple deprivation in a British town other than Liverpool. Complement the maps with a short description of what they show, stressing the relevant aspects you would want your readers to focus on. Keep in mind this needs to be short and to the point, as the report will be passed to a journalist who will draft the final article for the newspaper. In addition to the figures and text, provide annotated code that allows to replicate the visualization.

**Minimum requirements** (complete *all*)

* Choose a city/local authority in the UK that is not Liverpool, preferably one you know.
* Obtain the Index of Multiple Deprivation as well as census demographic data.
* Compose a map with different layers.
* Include a "zoom" of the global map by subsetting the original data.
* At least three and no more than five maps.
* Up to 500 words describing the patterns in the maps.

**Optional suggestions** (include *at least one*)

* Join deprivation indices from areas to building data to create a more aesthetic visualization.
* Discuss deprivation at different geographical scales.
* Compare the effect of different choropleth classification algorithms on visualizing deprivation.
* Explore the composition of the multiple deprivation as it relates to Census more basic variables (e.g. income, building age, etc.).
* Try to characterize the overall pattern found in the maps (is it concentrated, dispersed, agglomerated into different hotspots or something totally different?).
* Cross-check empirical findings with "common wisdom" about the areas where you have local knowledge.
* Begin to explore the underlying social processes for the empirical findings of your analysis.
* Exchange some of the maps for non-spatial graphics (scatter plots, bar charts, etc.).

**Data**

* CDRC Census Geodata pack.
* CDRC Census Data pack.
* 2015 Index of Multiple Deprivation.
