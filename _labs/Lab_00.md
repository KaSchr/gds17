title: Lab 0 - Tools
---

---

**IMPORTANT** This is a supplementary notebook that covers many basics of the tools we will use in the course, but does not explain anything directly related to Geographic Data Science. 

Students are encouraged to read it once before getting started with the other notebooks and then keep it as a reference throughout the rest of the course.

**TIP**: Here you can find a step-by-step tutorial about how to start up the notebook, download files, and access them through the notebook:

* Gallery of [interesting notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks): a wealth of examples of Jupyter (formerly called IPython) notebooks.
* {% cite downey2012 %}: very good general introduction to Python as a programming language and to the algorithmic way of thinking.
