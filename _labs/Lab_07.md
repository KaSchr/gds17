### Data

This lab uses a sample of geo-referenced tweets for the city of Liverpool. Go to the [Datasets](../datasets.html) tab and check the "Geo-referenced tweets" section to find out more information about the data as well as instructions to download it.

### Required before the practical

Watch the section on points of the SciPy'16 tutorial on Geographic Data Science with PySAL.

### Additional materials

* A very good resource for kernel density estimation in Python is provided in [this blog post](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/12/01/kernel-density-estimation/) by Jake Vanderplas.
* The R package [`spatstat`](http://spatstat.github.io/) provides extensive functionality to statistically describe and model point patterns.
