### Data

This session uses the **"Index of Multiple Deprivation""** dataset as well as the Ordnance Survey **(OS) Geodata Pack**. Go to the [Datasets](../datasets.html) tab to find out more information as well as instructions to download it.

Additionally, you will need the raster file for the basemap of Liverpool. This has been assembled by [Dani Arribas-Bel](http://darribas.org) from the [OS VectorMap District (Backdrop Raster)](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/vectormap-district.html), and it is licensed as OpenData. The file is available for download on the following link:
