### Data

This session uses the **"AirBnb listing for Inner London - MSOA level"** dataset. Go to the [Datasets](../datasets.html) tab to find out more information as well as instructions to download it.

### Required before the practical

Watch the section on spatial clustering of the SciPy'16 tutorial on Geographic Data Science with PySAL.

### Additional materials

* Although a bit more advanced, the documentation for [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org), a world-class Python library for machine learning, is excellent and includes many examples that cover the entire functionality set of the library.
