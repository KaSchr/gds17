### Additional materials

* A good introduction to the `geopandas` project is provided by Kelsey Jordahl, the project's founder in this [set of slides](http://kjordahl.github.io/SciPy-Tutorial-2015/#1) from a 2015 talk and the companion [repository](https://github.com/kjordahl/SciPy-Tutorial-2015).
* An additional great resource is this 4h. [workshop](https://github.com/carsonfarmer/python_geospatial) by Carson Farmer.
