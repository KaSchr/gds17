### To do before class

* Lecture on  "Spatial Weights" by Luc Anselin ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydFmI6ZGLQ8) to 34min video). Keep in mind the motivation in this case if focused on spatial regression.
* Lecture on "Special lag" by Luc Anselin ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQACCcfTpXc) to video, you can ignore the last five minutes as they are a bit more advanced).
