# Summary

This paper presents a computational learning module on Geographic Data
Science (GDS). This resource is part of a larger set, that also includes a series of
lecture slides, that has been used for three conscutive academic years to
teach the course "Geographic Data Science" at the University of Liverpool.

# Statement of need

This module is needed because both the contents are relevant, and the
available set of options to teach them leaves clear gaps. A large proportion
of the data society generates nowadays, from smartphone GPS logs to credit card
transactions to web activity, is directly or indirecly geographic. This means
that every observation can be associated with a particular set of map coordinates,
analysed spatially, and acted upon taking into account the implications of its
spatial location. This approach can bring a new set of perspectives to several
questions.
At the 
same time, traditional resources for teaching the handling, visualisation, and
analysis of geographic data are based on a paradigm that emphasises graphical
interfaces and "point-and-click" software packages. This approach is entirely
valid but, in many contexts, it limits the flexiblity with which the analyst
can effectively move from data to insights. 

# Learning objectives

This module has been designed so, upon completion, students are able to:

* Demonstrate advanced GDS concepts and be able to use the tools
  programmatically to import, manipulate and analyse spatial data in
  different formats.
* Understand the motivation and inner workings of the main methodological 
  approcahes of GDS, both analytical and visual.
* Critically evaluate the suitability of a specific technique, what it can
  offer and how it can help answer questions of interest.
* Apply a number of spatial analysis techniques in Python and explain how
  to interpret the results, in a process of turning data into information.
* When faced with a new data-set, work independently using GDS tools
  programmatically to extract valuable insight.
